            <h2> Kendall Henderson has spent her career as a teacher by day and teacher by night for many years. She has
                thrived and survived in countless environments that have made her an expert on adversity, adaptability,
                attentive, and amiable. These tools have brought her great success in the teaching world, but she now
                has her sights set on the world of coding and the relativity it has when it comes to being creative and
                problem solving. (things she felt best at in her other world) Kendall has been learning and growing with
                gaining more and more knowledge with html, css, JavaScript, API's, and many more to come. She knows
                there's a vast amount to learn and she is ready to tackle any project that is thrown her way. Please
                take a peak at what she has accomplished thus far, and do not hestistant to shoot any questions or
                inquiries her way. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to visit this page and get to know
                Kendall a little bit more.

        <p class="project_1"> I worked on this project
                with a great team! We wanted to do something with music and once
                we settled on tying that idea with a personal planners, then I came up with the name for the project
                "Fine
                Tune Your Day" and our transition from concept, deligation, coding, using api's, and seeing our final product come to life was an amazing experience. I was mainly in charge of our styling using bulma in the html and creating code in css. I am
                proud
                of how our team collaborted and the knowledge I gained throughout this project.
